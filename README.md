We started this project during the Texas A&M University Aggie Coding Club's first Hackathon. It's an ongoing project to
create an application for a Nexus 5X phone (API 28) using Android Studio.

This is a twist on the classic ["Sliding Puzzle."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle) Instead using a few 
pre-generated pictures, we allow the user to decide the size of their puzzle and take the picture using their camera.
